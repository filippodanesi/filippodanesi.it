These updates, which had a substantial impact on search results, reflect Google’s increasing focus on content quality and the fight against manipulative practices. In this article, we will analyze in detail the implications of these updates for industry professionals, providing in-depth technical information and practical tips for adapting to the new scenario.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-march-2024-core-update-characteristics-and-impact\">The March 2024 Core Update: Characteristics and Impact</h3>\n<p>Let’s start with the March 2024 Core Update, described by Google as a more complex update than usual that involved multiple ranking systems. Launched on March 5, it took a full 45 days to complete the rollout, much longer than the 2-week average for this type of update. This unusual duration suggests that Google made <strong>substantial and sophisticated changes</strong> to its algorithms.</p>\n<p>Chris Nelson from Google <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2024/03/core-update-spam-policies?hl=en\">explained</a> that <strong>this core update marks an evolution</strong> in how the algorithm identifies the usefulness of content. Instead of relying on a single signal or system, Google has improved its ranking systems to show more helpful results using a variety of innovative signals and approaches. This means there is no longer a predominant factor determining a page’s ranking, but a <strong>combination of elements</strong> that assess the quality and relevance of the content.</p>\n<p>The stated goal is to reduce content created primarily to attract clicks and rank on search engines, in favor of content that people actually find useful. Based on Google’s assessments, the combination of this update and previous efforts should lead to a <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-march-2024-core-update/510243/\"><strong>40% reduction in low-quality and unoriginal content</strong></a> in search results. This is a significant change that rewards websites that invest in creating valuable content for users.</p>\n<p>Another significant development is that the core update has incorporated the “helpful content” system introduced in September 2023. This system uses a <strong>machine learning model</strong> to identify content that appears to have been created primarily for search engine rankings, rather than to help or inform people. With the integration into the core update, there will no longer be separate announcements for helpful content updates. This further emphasizes the importance of <a href=\"https://www.serp-secrets.com/seo-strategies/adapting-to-googles-helpful-content-era/\">creating useful, user-centric content</a>, as this is now a fundamental component of the ranking algorithm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-march-2024-spam-update-new-policies-and-tools\">The March 2024 Spam Update: New Policies and Tools</h3>\n<p>Let’s move on to the March 2024 Spam Update, which concluded on March 20 after nearly 15 days of rollout. This specific update to combat spam was accompanied by the introduction of <strong>three new policies</strong> by Google:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Scaled content abuse</strong>: Producing content on a large scale with the primary objective of manipulating ranking, regardless of whether generated by automation, humans, or a combination. This includes tactics like creating web pages with minor variations of content or automatically generating thousands of low-value pages.</li>\n<li><strong>Expired domain abuse</strong>: Purchasing expired domains and repurposing them primarily to give visibility to low-quality spam content. For example, a domain previously associated with an authoritative site might be recycled to host completely irrelevant content, in an attempt to exploit the domain’s reputation.</li>\n<li><strong>Site reputation abuse</strong>: Hosting low-value third-party content, produced primarily to exploit the hosting site’s reputation and scale the SERPs. This abusive practice exploits the “link juice” and other ranking signals of an authoritative site to boost low-quality content. The policy will come into effect in May 2024, giving site owners time to review and remove any problematic content.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As reported by <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/google-issues-search-ranking-penalties-through-manual-actions-438253\">Barry Schwartz on Search Engine Land</a>, immediately after the launch of the Spam Update, there was a <strong>high number of manual actions</strong> related to violations of these new rules. <strong>Manual actions</strong> are <strong>penalties imposed by Google’s human reviewers</strong> after manually verifying that a website violates the webmaster guidelines. Unlike algorithmic updates like the Spam Update, which result in an “automatic” demotion in rankings, manual actions require active intervention to remove the penalty, such as submitting a reconsideration request after removing the problematic content.</p>\n<p>In addition to the new policies, the March 2024 Spam Update likely coincided with improvements to <strong>SpamBrain</strong>, Google’s AI-based anti-spam system. SpamBrain uses machine learning to identify and nullify spam patterns, and is periodically refined to better detect existing spam and identify new manipulative tactics. While Google doesn’t disclose the technical details of how SpamBrain works to prevent spammers from circumventing it, it’s likely that the March update introduced new signals and patterns to detect policy violations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-adapt-to-the-new-seo-landscape-post-updates\">How to Adapt to the New SEO Landscape Post-Updates</h3>\n<p>In light of these significant updates, what strategies should be adopted to succeed in SEO in 2024 and beyond? Here are some practical tips:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Focus on content quality and usefulness</strong>: The latest Google updates underscore the importance of creating in-depth, well-researched, user-centric content that demonstrates expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (E-A-T). This means going beyond superficial keyword optimization and focusing on providing accurate, comprehensive, and valuable information to readers. Avoid superficial content or content created primarily for search engines.</li>\n<li><strong>Closely monitor site performance</strong>: With such impactful updates, it’s crucial to consistently track key site metrics (traffic, rankings, conversion rate, etc.) to promptly identify any issues. Use web analytics and rank tracking tools to detect sudden drops in traffic or positions, which could indicate a negative impact from the updates. Act promptly to identify and resolve any quality or compliance issues.</li>\n<li><strong>Review SEO practices in light of new policies</strong>: In light of the new anti-spam policies, it’s essential to ensure you’re not engaging in risky practices such as large-scale content production for manipulation purposes, recycling expired domains, or abusing site reputation. Conduct a thorough audit of your site to identify any questionable tactics and address them. Always follow Google’s webmaster guidelines and focus on creating value for users rather than short-term tricks.</li>\n<li><strong>Use AI ethically and strategically</strong>: Artificial intelligence can be a valuable ally in optimizing the content creation process, but it must be used ethically and intelligently. Tools like ChatGPT can help generate ideas, conduct research, and create initial drafts, but the raw output of language models should always be reviewed, expanded, and refined by human experts who can add value and originality. AI should be seen as a tool to enhance efficiency and quality, not as a substitute for human judgment and expertise.</li>\n<li><strong>Be patient and persistent</strong>: Regaining ranking after an update takes time and consistent effort. Google’s automated systems take months to register changes made to a site and assess their impact on quality and relevance. Don’t expect immediate results, but stay the course, consistently producing quality content and waiting for efforts to be rewarded. Avoid overreacting or making drastic changes to the site immediately after an update, as this could worsen the situation.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion-quality-always-wins\">Conclusion: Quality Always Wins</h3>\n<p>In an ever-evolving SEO landscape, the only certainty seems to be Google’s <strong>increasing focus on content quality and user experience</strong>. The latest updates, particularly the March 2024 Core Update and Spam Update, demonstrate that <strong>tricks or shortcuts</strong> are no longer enough to succeed in organic search.</p>\n<p>The path to follow is to create <strong>in-depth, authoritative, and genuinely useful content</strong> for people, leveraging technology ethically to enhance (not replace) the human touch.
